This repo contains code I authored and co-authored over Summer 2024 working as a Tech Consultant/Research Intern for Chicago Tech Circle in partnership with Argonne National Laboratory. 
The functions.py file is originally from our group's repo. I re-uploaded it in this repo with only functions I contributed to. 
These functions are used to automatically move a microscope's stage and move from place to place within a sample in a specified order as well as to detect squares (in this case diamond membranes) using OpenCV.
